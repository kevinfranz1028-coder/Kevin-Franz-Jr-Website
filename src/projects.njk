        <h2>Film Study & Basketball IQ</h2>
        <p>I spend hours each week breaking down film – both our games and college guards I admire. I'm obsessed with understanding why certain plays work, how great guards read defenses, and what makes a team click.</p>

        <h2>Leadership & Mentorship</h2>
        <p>I mentor younger players in our program, helping them with ball-handling drills and understanding defensive rotations. Teaching the game has made me a better player and leader.</p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Earn a college scholarship and play at the next level</li>
            <li>Study meteorology and work as a broadcast meteorologist or researcher</li>
            <li>Keep learning, competing, and growing as a person</li>
        </ul>
