## Saturday Skills Session

This weekend I had a two-hour skills session with my trainer, Coach [Name]. We focused on two main areas:

### 1. Ball Screen Reads

We worked on reading different ball screen coverages:
- **Drop coverage** – Attacking the gap and making the big commit
- **Switch** – Using my speed advantage to get downhill
- **Hedge and recover** – Making the quick read to hit the roll man or reject the screen

The goal is to get faster at recognizing what the defense is showing *before* I get to the screen, so I can attack with a plan.

### 2. Mid-Range Pull-Ups

My three-point shot is solid, but I want to add a reliable mid-range game – especially off the bounce. We worked on:
- Footwork (inside foot plant, outside foot gather)
- Shoulder alignment on the gather
- Rhythm and balance at the release point

It felt awkward at first, but by the end of the session, I was hitting them consistently.

## Film Study

After the workout, I spent an hour watching film of college guards I admire – specifically how they navigate ball screens and create space.

A few takeaways:
- **Patience** – The best guards don't rush. They let the screen develop and read the defense.
- **Change of pace** – They use hesitation moves and sudden bursts to keep defenders off balance.
- **Vision** – They're always scanning for the open man, not just hunting their own shot.

## Week Ahead

This week we've got two games, including a rivalry matchup on Friday. Can't wait to put some of this work into action.
