## Tournament Highlights

This week we competed in the Holiday Classic Tournament, and it was one of the best experiences of the season so far. We went 3–1, making it to the championship game before falling short against a really talented team.

## Personal Performance

I averaged **14.5 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 5.0 assists** across the four games. More importantly, I felt like I was making the right reads – finding open teammates, pushing the pace when we had numbers, and not forcing anything.

The semifinal game was special. We were down 8 with four minutes left, and our defense just clicked. We held them to one field goal in the final four minutes and came back to win 58-56.

## What I Learned

1. **Trust the Process** – When we got down in the semifinal, I didn't panic. I trusted our defensive system and kept communicating.

2. **Read the Game** – In the championship, the other team was trapping ball screens. I got caught a couple times early, but adjusted by slipping passes to the roll man. By the second half, they had to back off.

3. **Leadership Matters** – Our senior captain went down with an ankle injury in game two. Stepping up vocally and keeping everyone engaged was a challenge, but it made me a better leader.

## Looking Ahead

We've got a week off for the holidays, then we're back at it with league play. I'm excited to build on this and keep improving.

Thanks to everyone who came out to support us this week!
