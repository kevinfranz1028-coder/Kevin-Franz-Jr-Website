Off the court, I'm just as serious about the classroom. I'm especially drawn to weather and atmospheric science and plan to study meteorology in college.\n\nMy goals are simple: help my team win, keep growing as a leader, and earn the opportunity to play college basketball while pursuing a degree that challenges me.",
